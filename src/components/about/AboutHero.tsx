              In recent decades, little progress has been made in improving commuting. There are two options: public transport and the car. Public transport lacks flexibility and is often saturated or unreliable. They serve predetermined axes, mainly in a starry network. The car offers flexibility and comfort, but at high cost. 70% of French people use their cars to work, with an annual budget of 6,049 euros for maintenance. Congestion, pollution, and self-isolation are common problems. Alternatives such as cycling, walking, or scooting are mostly suitable for urban areas for short distances. For peri-urban or rural areas, Tristan Croiset and Olivier Binet founded Karos, convinced that the French are ready to share their vehicles.
